  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increasing `x` moves the glyph to the right,
  # increasing `y` moves the glyph upward.
